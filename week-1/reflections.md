# 1.1 Think about Time Reflection

The time management and productivity ideas I found most interesting were breaking down big tasks into smaller ones, and repeating until the task reaches a manageable size, and the idea of "Flow". I also looked into the Pomodoro method, which I think is a great tool to maintain mental agility when faced with a lot of work. 

Time boxing is the idea of working toward a goal for a preset amount of time instead of working on the goal until you achieve it and seeing how long it took you. It allows you evaluate how much work you actually got done within that time frame, and that allows you to better grasp how many time-boxes you need to finish the task. It breaks down the task into more manageable size segments, and it will allow you to reflect on the amount of work that you were able to get done. The Pomodoro method is an example of time boxing that I plan on using to increase my productivity throughout this program.

Currently I set a loose schedule of what I have to do during the day, but it is tough to follow because each task is only estimated and I tend to run over, leading to the schedule consistently being pushed back. I am realizing now that this might not be the best way for me to get things done. When I see what time it is after I have completed any task and I've gone over into when I am supposed to start the next task, it builds up some anxiety. This can lead to either more anxiety, or me having to step away from the tasks for awhile, causing them to take even longer than I have planned. 

I do plan on starting to use some of these methods. Reading about the state of flow really interested me, because I know I have been in that state before, I know how it feels and I am now open to begin recognizing when I am entering into that state and trying to maximize the time I am able to stay there. I also plan on using the Pomodoro method when I am coding. It seems like it would be a really good thing to take a few minutes to just rest your eyes and brain and recharge a little of your energy and focus. 

My overall plan for time management for Phase 0 is to start my work after lunch, and to utilize the Pomodoro method to work through until 5, taking longer breaks when I need them. I am going to do this Monday-Friday until I get everything done that I need to be done. I am going for one longer session a day (with breaks) to try and prepare myself for the intense in-session part of this program. It will be good for me to form the habits of taking breaks while working, and working on strengthening my focus. 

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is a program that allows you to use the command line interface like a traditional UNIX system on a non UNIX system. Bash is a shell that runs a UNIX like operating system but is not UNIX. 

The most challenging aspect of this material was getting used to the format and reading the program. It was also challenging keeping up with the video presentation having had no prior experience with UNIX. It was very confusing trying to pick up anything I could about the syntax and what commands did what. 

I was able to successfully use all of the commands except for 'man' and 'apropos', but the command 'help' worked the same way and did the same function.

I think cat and less are both very important commands. Cat seems like it will be more useful as we move into more complicated code. cd is also good to be comfortable with to be able to easily navigate through all your directories. 

pwd - print working directory 

ls - list directory

mv - move file

cd - change directory

../ - can't say I remember this one...

touch - creates and empty file

mkdir - makes directory

less - lists the contents of a file in a format that can be scrolled both up and down

rmdir - removes a directory iff it is empty

rm - removes file

help - provides a description of the command you need help with
### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
A Git repository is how git stores your information. The repository itself is just that, a storage unit for specific information structured in a particular way. To create a new git repository, we must first open up out Git program. Once in there, you can determine where you want your repository to be located. For this you can either create a new directory or use an existing directory. Once you are inside the desired directory, you simply type the command 

git init

and this creates your repository in the current directory. To fork a repository, you must find the repository you wish to fork on GitHub. Once there you can simply click 'Fork' in the top right corner of the webpage, and it will save to your profile. This will allow you to work on the forked repository.

To clone a repository, go back to the webpage of the repository you just forked. On the right hand side of the webpage you will see a box with the header "HTTPS clone URL". You will need to copy the URL in the box directly beneath that. Once you have that copied, open up git on your computer and go to the desired directory you wish to clone the repository to. Once you are there, simply type the command 

git clone PUTURLHERE

And voila! The repository has been cloned to your local git directory. The benefits to forking a repository as opposed to creating a new one is that there has already been work done to this repository, and you can add onto that work instead of re-doing all the work that has already been done. 

 

Setting up GitHub was relatively straightforward. I had no problems getting my account in order, nor forking the repositories for this challenge. I had some problems setting up git initially, but that was do mainly to my confusion at the command line setup in general. I had trouble figuring out how to navigate directories, but I figured that out pretty quickly. I learned that it is a very straightforward program (so far) and that you really just have to get used to the GUI-less navigation and commanding of a computer.
