What does it mean to iterate over an array?

To iterate over an array means to go through the array objects. Iteration usually involves a test or something that you are looking for within that array. 

How are arrays structured? What can they contain?
Arrays are structured in a numbered pattern, with each object having a numbered place within the array. They can contain any data type within ruby, even other arrays!


Based on what you've learned, what is the best way to access values in a hash?

The best way is using the key to access the requested object.

What are some important things to remember about hash keys and uniqueness?

It is possible to have 2 hash keys that point to the same object. You can even have multiple hash keys with the same object, so long as they are equal. This can lead you to have multiple versions of the same information within your hash. 


What are the main differences between arrays and hashes? When do you think one will be better over the other?

The main difference is the order in which they are held. Hashes provide you with more flexibility with the information you provide, while arrays force your information into a very set order. Say you want to know what genre a movie is, you can do that with a hash and not with an array. Hashes seem to have a wider breadth of usage, but arrays are simpler and don't rely on human organization skills to keep their affairs(objects, whatever) in order.
