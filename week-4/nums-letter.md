#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number while a float is a number with any decimal after it.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The different between float and integer division is that integer division will return your answers as integers, while float will return the correct answer. As in dividing 9 by 2, integer division will return an answer of 4 (closest complete number) and float division of 9.0/2.0 would be 4.5 (actual mathematically correct answer).

'''ruby
x = 365 * 24
puts "Hours in a year: #{x}"

y = 60*24*3650
puts "Minutes in a decade: #{y}"
